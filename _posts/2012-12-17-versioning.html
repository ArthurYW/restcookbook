<p class="question">What is the correct way to version my API?</p>

<p>The "URL" way</p>
A commonly used way to version your API is to add a version number in the URL. For instance:

<pre>
/api/v1/article/1234
</pre>

To "move" to another API, one could increase the version number:

<pre>
/api/v2/article/1234
</pre>


<p>The hypermedia way</p>

<pre>
GET /api/article/1234 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.api.article+xml; version=1.0
</pre>
